net: A clojure Netty companion
================================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/pyr/net.png)](http://travis-ci.org/pyr/net)

Net provides a clojure foundation to implement asynchronous networking
based on Netty.

It is much narrower in scope and features than
[aleph](https://github.com/ztellman/aleph), which you might want to
look into if you want a full-fledged asynchronous programming toolkit
for clojure.

**net** is rather geared towards people with prior Netty knowledge
wanting to keep the same workflow in, *hopefully*, idiomatic Clojure,
and nothing but standard clojure facilities.

- Light facades around Netty concepts such as channels, pipelines,
  channel initializers and bootstraps
- Facilities to create TLS client and server contexts from PEM files
- Ring-like HTTP(S) server facade
- HTTP(S) client
- Simple interface to create TCP server with optional TLS support
- Clojure [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async) support
- Memory-efficient transducers for collections of ByteBufs

## Documentation

Net now has full [API Documentation](http://pyr.github.io/net) and
[Guides](http://pyr.github.io/net/intro.html).

## Installation

```clojure
