net: the clojure netty companion
================================

Net provides a clojure foundation to implement asynchronous networking
based on netty.

It is much narrower in scope and features than
[aleph](https://github.com/ztellman/aleph), which you might want to
look into if you want a full-fledged asynchronous programming toolkit
for clojure.

**net** is rather geared towards people with prior netty knowledge
wanting to keep the same workflow in, *hopefully*, idiomatic Clojure,
and nothing but standard clojure facilities.

- Light facades around netty concepts such as channels, pipelines,
  channel initializers and bootstraps
- Facilities to create TLS client and server contexts from PEM files
- Ring-like HTTP(S) server facade
- HTTP(S) client
- Simple interface to create TCP server with optional TLS support
- Clojure [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async) support

## Installation

```clojure
    [[spootnik/net "0.3.3-beta1"]]
